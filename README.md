#How I Made this Application
This application was made with HTML, CSS, JS, and Express!

#How I feel after completion
-I completed the challenge: 5
-I feel good about my code: 4
-I wanted to add an element that could eliminate the crossed list Items rather than all items, but it did not function properly when running with express. I plan to go back and try again!

#Lessons Learned

Through this project I was able to explre express! Working on this project was apart of my introduction to express abnd CRUD, and helped me fully understand the usesses of both.
